# Google Playstore App Market Analysis
- A small team of RMIT IT students wants to make a profitable mobile application. Their goals are to have a production-grade application with premium content and quality 
so that customers will pay for the product.
- The team did some market researching mostly on the websites and got some cool findings. However, they are uncertain which app category they should focus on, 
what is a good starting price, and how big or complex the app should be?
- This project is born to solve these uncertainties.
